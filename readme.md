## General working
 - Creates a local searchable database of your organizer bins and their placements within your racks.
 - Can be used for anything where you need to search.


## Info
 - It is a standalone application.
 - Contains self hosted database (as variables).
 - The software does not need any electronics, wiring and Arduino at the moment.
 - You can still DIY Electronics and wire the LEDs based on the output of the search results.
